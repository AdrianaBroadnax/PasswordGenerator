# PasswordGenerator

## JavaScript
In order to generate a password i needed the two main functions password and characters
then i put all the vars needed to make up the password generater, so i needed the main var that will be helping with the charcter input and the arrays to help generate the password.
next, insert a welcome window
then, start the probing questions
    how long did you want the password? must be between 8-128 characters , if didnt meet the requirements they would get kicked out. 
    any upper case letters?
    lower case letters?
    numbers? or symbols?
after, i maade sure if they didnt pick one type of character, they would return to the main screen.
after that i wrote a code on how to generate the password.
fiinally added the generate button to enable.
